# Swift-UI Music Player
A small project to learn new Swift UI format and syntax. The goal of this project was to understand the different concepts of Swift UI while implimenting it into 
a music player app that will be able to connect with Apple Music once I do buy the developer license. For now, it is a proof of concept and idea of what is trying 
to be accomplished. 

 The UIImageColors file is being used to change the colors in the player dynamically based on the album art. This tool was created by Jathu Satkunarajah
 and can be found at - https://github.com/jathu/UIImageColors
